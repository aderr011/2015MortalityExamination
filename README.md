# 2015MortalityExamination
Examination of CDC's 2015 Mortality Dataset. Intended to answer questions related to the death of American residents

Utilizing libraries like numpy and pandas, I was able to answer the questions below:

  - What is the most common cause of death?
  - Where do the most deaths occur?
  - What is the relationship between race and death?
  - What is the distribution of total deaths of each month?
  - What months are suicide rates highest for 20-24 year olds?
  - What level of education did 45-49 year olds have when they died?
  - What is the distribution of deaths for each age group?
  - What is the most common cause of death for each age group?

The answer is depicted through understandable graphics and consumable statistics.
